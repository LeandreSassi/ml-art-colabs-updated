# ml-art-colabs-updated
In this repo I gathered the tested (as on November 2023) Art ML colabs found in Derrick Schultz's collection that we can find here: https://github.com/dvschultz/ml-art-colabs

The reason I do this is to try to keep the work alive that has been done despite some libraries having changed, and causing some issues. 

I am facing some issues regarding some colabs, as soon as I find a way to get them working, I will publish my fork.
